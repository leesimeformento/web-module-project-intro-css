       <p>Not just a great valley, but a shrine to human foresight, the strength of granite, the<br>
        power of glaciers, the persistence of life, and the tranquility of the High Sierra.</p>
      
      <p>First protected in 1864, Yosemite National Park is best known for its waterfalls, but<br> its nearly
      giant sequoias, a vast wilderness area, and much more.</p>

      <p>Fire is a natural and essential<br>
       part of Yosemite. We manage fire<br>
        carefully and study how it<br>
         interacts with the park’s <br>
         ecosystems. This blog provides<br>
          updates about fires in Yosemite.<br>
           Check for current fire restrictions.</p>
